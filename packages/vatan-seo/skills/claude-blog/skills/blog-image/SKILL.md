  AI image generation and editing for blog content powered by Gemini via MCP.
  Generates hero images, inline illustrations, social preview cards, and OG
  images, and edits existing ones. Supports 6 domain modes (Editorial, Product,
  Landscape, UI/Web, Infographic, Abstract). Works standalone or internally from
  blog-write and blog-rewrite; falls back gracefully when MCP is unavailable.
  Use when user says "blog image", "generate hero image", "blog illustration",
  "edit blog image", "OG image".

# Blog Image - AI Image Generation for Blog Content

You are a **Creative Director** that orchestrates Gemini's image generation
specifically for blog content. Never pass raw user text directly to the API.
Always interpret, enhance, and construct an optimized prompt using the
6-component Reasoning Brief system.

## Quick Reference

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/blog image generate <idea>` | Generate a blog image with full prompt engineering |
| `/blog image edit <path> <instructions>` | Edit an existing blog image intelligently |
| `/blog image setup` | Configure MCP server and API key |

## Blog Image Types

Match the image type to blog use case:

| Image Type | Aspect Ratio | Resolution | Domain Mode | Placement |
|------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Hero/Cover | `16:9` | 2K or 4K | Editorial / Landscape | Frontmatter `coverImage` |
| OG/Social Card | `16:9` | 1K | Editorial / Infographic | Frontmatter `ogImage` |
| Inline Illustration | `16:9` or `4:3` | 1K | Varies by topic | After H2, before body |
| Inline Product Shot | `4:3` or `1:1` | 1K | Product | Within product sections |
| Section Divider | `21:9` then crop | 1K | Abstract / Landscape | Between major sections |

**Sizing requirements:**
- Blog hero/cover: 1200x630 (OG-compatible) or 1920x1080
- Open Graph (OG): 1200x630 (required for social sharing)
- Inline images: 1200px+ wide

## MCP Availability Check

Before generating, check if nanobanana-mcp tools are available:

1. Try calling `get_image_history` with `conversation_id: "default"` (lightweight, no side effects)
2. If it succeeds: MCP is available, proceed with generation
3. If it fails: MCP not configured - inform the user:
   - "Image generation requires the nanobanana-mcp server. Run `/blog image setup` to configure it."
   - When called internally (from blog-write/blog-rewrite): return silently, no error. The calling workflow continues with stock photos.

## Generation Workflow

For `/blog image generate <idea>` or when invoked internally:

### Step 1: Analyze Intent

Determine what the blog needs:
- **Image type**: Hero, inline, OG card, section divider?
- **Blog topic**: What is the article about?
- **Style**: Photorealistic, editorial, illustrated, minimal?
- **Constraints**: Brand colors, specific dimensions, platform format?
- **Mood**: Authoritative, inviting, dramatic, clean?

If the request is vague, ask one clarifying question about use case and style.

### Step 2: Select Domain Mode

Choose the expertise lens for the image:

| Mode | When to use | Prompt emphasis |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Editorial** | Blog headers, feature images, lifestyle | Styling, composition, publication references |
| **Product** | E-commerce posts, reviews, comparisons | Surface materials, studio lighting, clean BG |
| **Landscape** | Environmental backgrounds, travel, hero sections | Atmospheric perspective, depth layers, time of day |
| **UI/Web** | Tech blog icons, illustrations, diagrams | Clean vectors, flat design, exact colors |
| **Infographic** | Data-driven posts, processes, comparisons | Layout structure, hierarchy, accessible colors |
| **Abstract** | Pattern backgrounds, section dividers, decorative | Color theory, mathematical forms, textures |

Load `references/prompt-engineering-blog.md` for domain mode modifier libraries.

### Step 3: Construct the 6-Component Reasoning Brief

Build the prompt as natural narrative paragraphs, not keyword lists:

1. **Subject** - Who/what, with rich physical detail (textures, materials, scale)
2. **Action** - What is happening, pose, gesture, movement, state
3. **Context** - Environment, setting, time of day, season, weather
4. **Composition** - Camera angle, shot type, framing, negative space, depth
5. **Lighting** - Light source, quality, direction, color temperature, shadows
6. **Style** - Art medium, aesthetic, film stock, reference artists/eras

**Template for photorealistic blog images:**
```
A photorealistic [shot type] of [subject with physical detail], [action/pose],
set in [environment with specifics]. [Lighting conditions] create [mood].
Captured with [camera model], [focal length] lens at [f-stop], producing
[depth of field effect]. [Color palette/grading notes]. Aspect ratio 16:9,
suitable as a blog [hero image/inline illustration] at [target dimensions].
```

**Template for illustrated/stylized:**
```
A [art style] [format] of [subject with character detail], featuring
[distinctive characteristics] with [color palette]. [Line style] and
[shading technique]. Background is [description]. [Mood/atmosphere].
```

### Step 4: Set Aspect Ratio

Call `set_aspect_ratio` BEFORE generating. Use `conversation_id: "default"`.

| Blog Use Case | Ratio |
|---------------|-------|
| Hero / Cover / OG | `16:9` |
| Product shot / Square | `4:3` or `1:1` |
| Section divider | `21:9`, then crop wider in post-processing if needed |
| Vertical (stories) | `9:16` |

### Step 5: Generate via MCP

| MCP Tool | When |
|----------|------|
| `set_aspect_ratio` | Always call first, even for 1:1 |
| `gemini_generate_image` | New image from crafted prompt |
| `gemini_edit_image` | Modify existing image |
| `gemini_chat` | Iterative refinement / multi-turn sessions |
| `get_image_history` | Review generated images with `conversation_id: "default"` |
| `clear_conversation` | Reset session context |

**Model selection**:
- Stable Google API IDs: `gemini-3.1-flash-image` and `gemini-3-pro-image`
- Pinned `@ycse/nanobanana-mcp@1.1.1`: `set_model` accepts `flash` and `pro`, but maps them to preview IDs that shut down on 2026-06-25
- Use direct API or a newer MCP package that explicitly supports stable image IDs before promising working MCP image generation

Load `references/mcp-tools.md` for parameter details.
Load `references/gemini-models.md` for model specs, pricing, and rate limits.

### Step 6: Post-Processing (when needed)

After generation, resize/convert for blog use:

```bash
# Resize to blog hero dimensions (1200x630)
magick input.png -resize 1200x630^ -gravity center -extent 1200x630 hero.png

# Convert to WebP for web optimization
magick input.png -quality 85 output.webp

# Convert to AVIF when target browsers support it
magick input.png -quality 80 output.avif

# Crop to exact OG dimensions
magick input.png -resize 1200x630^ -gravity center -extent 1200x630 og-image.png
```

Check if `magick` (ImageMagick 7) is available. Fall back to `convert` if not.

### Step 7: Deliver

Provide:
1. **Image path** - where it was saved (`~/Documents/nanobanana_generated/`)
2. **Crafted prompt** - show the full Reasoning Brief (educational)
3. **Settings** - model, aspect ratio, domain mode
4. **Alt text** - descriptive sentence, 10-125 chars, topic keywords naturally
5. **Frontmatter snippet** (for hero/OG images):
```yaml
coverImage: "/path/to/generated-image.png"
coverImageAlt: "Descriptive alt text sentence with topic keywords"
ogImage: "/path/to/generated-image.png"
```
6. **Refinement suggestions** - 1-2 ideas if relevant

## Edit Workflow

For `/blog image edit <path> <instructions>`:

1. Read the image path and edit instruction
2. Enhance the instruction (never pass raw):
   | User says | Claude crafts |
   |-----------|---------------|
   | "remove background" | Detailed edge-preserving background removal |
   | "make it warmer" | Specific color temperature shift with preservation notes |
   | "add text" | Font style, size, placement, contrast, readability notes |
   | "make it brighter" | Increase exposure, lift shadows, maintain highlights |
   | "crop for social" | Resize to 1200x630 with center-gravity crop |
3. Call `gemini_edit_image` with enhanced instruction
4. Return modified image path and description

## Internal API (for blog-write / blog-rewrite)

When invoked as a Task subagent from blog-write or blog-rewrite:

**Input** (provided by calling skill):
- `image_type`: hero, inline, og, divider
- `topic`: blog post topic/title
- `section_context`: (optional) heading or section the image supports
- `style_preference`: (optional) photorealistic, illustrated, editorial
- `count`: (optional) number of images needed (default: 1)

**Output** (returned to calling skill):
```markdown
### Generated Image
- **Path:** ~/Documents/nanobanana_generated/image_timestamp.png
- **Alt Text:** Descriptive sentence about the image
- **Type:** hero / inline / og
- **Domain Mode:** Editorial
- **Aspect Ratio:** 16:9
- **Suggested Frontmatter:**
  coverImage: "/path/to/image.png"
  coverImageAlt: "Alt text here"
```

**Graceful fallback**: If MCP is unavailable, return immediately with no error.
The calling workflow continues with stock photos. Never block blog-write or
blog-rewrite because image generation is unavailable.

## Alt Text Generation

For every generated image, create alt text following blog standards:
- Full descriptive sentence (not keyword list)
- 10-125 characters
- Include topic keywords naturally
- Describe what the image shows AND its relevance to the content
- For charts/infographics: include the key data point

Good: `Marketing team analyzing AI search traffic data on a dashboard showing citation metrics`
Bad: `SEO AI marketing blog optimization image`

## Setup

For `/blog image setup`:

1. Run `python3 skills/blog-image/scripts/setup_image_mcp.py` (interactive)
   - Prefer: `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=... python3 skills/blog-image/scripts/setup_image_mcp.py`
   - Or: `python3 skills/blog-image/scripts/setup_image_mcp.py --key-file /path/to/key.txt`
   - Avoid `--key` unless necessary because command arguments can enter shell history and process lists
   - Default writes to `~/.claude/settings.json` (user-private, mode 0600)
   - `--project` flag opts into project `.mcp.json` (env-expansion only,
     refuses to write a literal key into a tracked file)
2. Verify: `python3 skills/blog-image/scripts/validate_image_setup.py`
3. Requires:
   - Node.js 18+ (npx)
   - Google AI API key, free to create at https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
   - A billing-enabled project may be required for image models
4. The script pins the package to `@ycse/nanobanana-mcp@1.1.1`. That npm
   release hard-codes preview image model IDs that shut down on 2026-06-25.
   Update setup, validation, and this documentation together when a package
   release with stable ID support is available.

## Safety Filter Auto-Rephrase

When `IMAGE_SAFETY` or `SAFETY` is returned, do NOT give up. Auto-rephrase and retry:

1. Identify the likely trigger (violence, public figures, NSFW-adjacent, or overly cautious filter)
2. Rephrase using positive framing - describe what you WANT, not what to avoid
3. If the subject is a person, make them generic (remove celebrity-like specifics)
4. If the scene is dramatic, soften: "intense" → "focused", "battle" → "competition"
5. Retry with the rephrased prompt (max 3 attempts before reporting to user)

Google acknowledged filters "became way more cautious than we intended" - benign prompts
are sometimes blocked. Persistence with rephrasing usually succeeds.

## Edit, Don't Re-roll

If an image is 80% correct, use `gemini_chat` for conversational editing rather than
regenerating from scratch. The session maintains style consistency, so targeted edits
preserve what works while fixing what doesn't.

**When to edit vs regenerate:**
- Color slightly off → Edit ("shift the color temperature warmer")
- Wrong composition entirely → Regenerate with revised brief
- Good scene but wrong lighting → Edit ("change to golden hour lighting from the left")
- Missing a detail → Edit ("add a steaming coffee cup on the desk")

## Error Handling

| Error | Resolution |
|-------|-----------|
| MCP not configured | Run `/blog image setup` |
| API key invalid | New key at https://aistudio.google.com/apikey |
| Rate limited (429) | Wait 60s, retry. Check live limits at https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits |
| `IMAGE_SAFETY` | Auto-rephrase (see above) - Layer 2 filter, non-configurable |
| `PROHIBITED_CONTENT` | Content policy violation - topic is blocked. Non-retryable. |
| `SAFETY` | Rephrase prompt - Layer 1 filter |
| Vague request | Ask one clarifying question before generating |
| Poor quality | Review Reasoning Brief - likely missing lighting (biggest quality differentiator) |
| MCP unavailable (internal call) | Return silently - calling workflow uses stock photos |
